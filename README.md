# Vue Function API Converter (Work in progress)

This is a prototype for an eventual codemod to facilitate migrating components from the Object API to the [Function API](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/42). **Work in progress, not intended for usage in real projects yet.**

## How to run

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Run the demo:

```bash
yarn serve
```
